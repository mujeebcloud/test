### **Google Cloud Storage Bucket Troubleshooting Guide**

#### **1. Permission Denied Errors**
**Issue Description:**  
You receive a "Permission Denied" error when trying to access or modify a bucket or its objects.

**Common Causes:**
- Insufficient IAM permissions for the user or service account.
- Incorrect bucket-level or object-level ACLs (Access Control Lists).
- The bucket is configured with a restrictive IAM policy.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check IAM Permissions:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy <PROJECT_ID>
   ```
   Add the necessary role if missing:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> \
     --member="user:<EMAIL>" \
     --role="roles/storage.admin"
   ```

2. Inspect Bucket-Level Permissions:
   ```bash
   gsutil iam get gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```
   Update the IAM policy if needed:
   ```bash
   gsutil iam ch user:<EMAIL>:objectViewer gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

3. Verify ACLs (if applicable):
   ```bash
   gsutil acl get gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```
   Update ACLs if necessary:
   ```bash
   gsutil acl ch -u <EMAIL>:READER gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

4. Enable Uniform Bucket-Level Access:
   ```bash
   gsutil ubla set on gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

#### **2. CORS Configuration Issues**
**Issue Description:**  
Your application fails to access objects in the bucket due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions.

**Common Causes:**
- Missing or incorrect CORS configuration for the bucket.
- Mismatch between allowed origins, methods, or headers.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check Current CORS Configuration:
   ```bash
   gsutil cors get gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

2. Update CORS Configuration:
   Create a JSON file (`cors-config.json`) with the desired CORS rules:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "origin": ["https://example.com"],
       "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
       "method": ["GET", "HEAD"],
       "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
     }
   ]
   ```
   Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

3. Test CORS Behavior:
   Use `curl` to verify CORS headers:
   ```bash
   curl -I -H "Origin: https://example.com" https://storage.googleapis.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/<OBJECT_NAME>
   ```

#### **3. Bucket Not Found or Object Not Found**
**Issue Description:**  
You receive a "Bucket Not Found" or "Object Not Found" error when accessing a bucket or object.

**Common Causes:**
- Typographical errors in the bucket or object name.
- The bucket or object has been deleted.
- Regional restrictions or DNS propagation issues.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify Bucket Name:
   Ensure the bucket name follows GCS naming conventions.

2. Check Bucket Existence:
   ```bash
   gsutil ls
   ```

3. Check Object Existence:
   ```bash
   gsutil ls gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

4. Verify Regional Restrictions:
   If the bucket is dual-region or multi-region, ensure you're accessing it from the correct region.

5. DNS Propagation:
   Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation after creating a new bucket.

#### **4. Quota Exceeded Errors**
**Issue Description:**  
You encounter errors such as "Quota exceeded" when performing operations like uploading files or listing objects.

**Common Causes:**
- Exceeding API request quotas.
- Hitting storage limits for the project.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check Quota Usage:
   View your current quota usage in the Google Cloud Console under **IAM & Admin > Quotas** or use:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute project-info describe --project <PROJECT_ID>
   ```

2. Request Quota Increase:
   Submit a quota increase request through the Google Cloud Console.

3. Optimize API Usage:
   Use batch requests or pagination to reduce the number of API calls.

---

#### **5. Upload/Download Failures**
**Issue Description:**  
Uploads or downloads fail with errors like "Connection reset" or "Timeout."

**Common Causes:**
- Network instability.
- Large file uploads exceeding default timeouts.
- Insufficient permissions.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check Network Connectivity:
   Ensure stable internet connectivity and test connectivity:
   ```bash
   ping storage.googleapis.com
   ```

2. Increase Timeout Settings:
   For large file uploads, increase the timeout:
   ```bash
   gsutil -o GSUtil:default_api_version=2 cp large-file gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

3. Use Resumable Uploads:
   Enable resumable uploads for large files:
   ```bash
   gsutil cp -R large-directory gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

4. Verify Permissions:
   Ensure the user or service account has the `storage.objects.create` or `storage.objects.get` permission.

---

#### **6. Billing and Cost Issues**
**Issue Description:**  
Unexpected charges or inability to create buckets due to billing issues.

**Common Causes:**
- Misconfigured lifecycle policies leading to unexpected storage costs.
- Billing account linked to the project is suspended or invalid.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Review Billing Account:
   Ensure the billing account is active and properly linked to the project.

2. Analyze Storage Costs:
   Use the Google Cloud Console's **Cost Management** tools to review storage usage and costs.

3. Optimize Lifecycle Policies:
   Configure lifecycle rules to transition or delete unused objects:
   ```yaml
   lifecycle:
     rule:
       - action:
           type: Delete
         condition:
           age: 30
   ```

4. Enable Requester Pays:
   Shift costs to the requester:
   ```bash
   gsutil requesterpays set on gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

---

#### **7. Public Access Issues**
**Issue Description:**  
Objects are unintentionally publicly accessible, or public access is blocked when expected.

**Common Causes:**
- Misconfigured IAM or ACLs allowing public access.
- Public access prevention settings blocking legitimate access.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check Public Access Prevention:
   ```bash
   gsutil uniformbucketlevelaccess get gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

2. Audit IAM and ACLs:
   ```bash
   gsutil iam get gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

3. Block Public Access:
   Enable public access prevention:
   ```bash
   gsutil uniformbucketlevelaccess set on gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
   ```

4. Grant Specific Access:
   Use signed URLs or signed policy documents for controlled public access.
